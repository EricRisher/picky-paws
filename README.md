## Description
The motivation for this app was the desire to aid pet parents in deciding what may be the best nourishment for their own pets. Our team wanted to design an app that is clear and easy to navigate. Our app allows for seemless communication between 
dog and cat guardians in an effort to make improved decisions to put together a good diet for their animals by giving them access to food reviews written by other pet parents, as well as a platform to leave their own feedback. 
Our homepage will introduce a few options, simple,clear and to the point making the app easy to navigate. A user ay create profile easy to help keep track of their posts, and otherother reviews saving them time by making everything easily accessible. Customer feedback is importatn to us, as it helps to understand logic behind the code, making it easier to improve.
