## Description
The motivation for this app was the desire to aid pet parents in deciding what may be the best nourishment for their own pets. Our team wanted to design an app that is clear and easy to navigate. Our app allows for seamless communication between 
dog and cat guardians in an effort to make improved decisions to put together a good diet for their animals by giving them access to food reviews written by other pet parents, as well as a platform to leave their own feedback. 
Homepage will introduce few options, simple/clear and to the point, easy to navigate with home, profile easy to keep track of your posts, section for reviews, saving the people time. Customer feedback helps to understand logic behind the code, making it easier to improve/help/contribute (put this in the “rules for improvement” part?)
